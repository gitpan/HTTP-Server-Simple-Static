Revision history for Perl extension HTTP:Server::Simple::Static

0.05  Mon,  6 Nov 2006 09:29:42 +0000

        - Applied patch from Max Maischein to use the binmode function
          rather than the binmode method of IO::File, which only exists
          in newer versions of that module which we were not requiring.

        - Applied patch from Tom Hukins to make
          HTTP::Server::Simple::Static RFC compliant. Section 4.1 of
          RFC 2616, "Message Types", states that header fields should
          be separated by CRLF. This is done in the manner recommended
          in perlport(1).
        - Also applied patch from Tom Hukins to add the "use bytes"
          pragma to ensure Content-Length contains the number of bytes
          in the response body, not the number of characters.

        - Fixed documentation to show that HTTP::Server::Simple::CGI
          should be used as the base class.
          Closes: http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18682
        - Switched to using IO::File for the file handling, also
          turned on binmode to help those on Windows serve images, etc.
